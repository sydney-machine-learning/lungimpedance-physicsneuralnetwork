## Physics informed neural ladder network for evaluating the impedance of the conduction airways
The aim is to determine the general impedence of human lungs by subsuming varying Navier Stokes PDEs with varying isotropic strain equation for different generation of lungs as a ladder network and to utilise Physics Informed Neural Networks to solve the partial differential equations and achieve the above task.

### Dataset Generation
The airways generation is divided into 100 radial points with equal intervals between the centre to the wall of the airways. The centre, the wall boundary and all the other 99 points are evaluated axially. 200 equally distanced axial points are taken in the ùëß direction. Every generation is divided into 100 radial point and 200 axial points. The velocity, velocity components and the pressure for each point is recorded. The patterns of the axial solutions are observed.

### Model Framework
Human airways have a tree like structure and is divided into conducting and the respiratory zone. These zones are identified using generation numbers from 0 to 23. The overall impedance of an infinite ladder network can be expressed as continued fraction. The PDE used in the lung flow analysis is the Navier-
Stokes equation for laminar incompressible flow. The first generation of airways has a transition of laminar and turbulent flow while all the other generations have laminar flow. For consistency and simplicity, all the generations including the trachea are evaluated for laminar flow. The general form of the incompressible Navier-stokes equation is given as:
* `u_x + v_y = 0`
* `u*u_x + v*u_y + p_x/rho - nu*(u_xx + u_yy) = 0`
* `u*v_x + v*v_y + p_y/rho - nu*(v_xx + v_yy) = 0`

This equation is modelled using the Physics Informed Neural Network Model. 
The overall average impedance for any point (r, z) can be evaluated as:

where ùëÅ is the total evaluation points in the generation and ùëõ is the size of intervals points taken in the axial direction. 

The overall framework is shown below:

### Results
We run our model for 3 generations and generate simulations. For every generation we take 6 different boundary conditions and generate results.
