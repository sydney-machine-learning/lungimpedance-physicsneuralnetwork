## Dataset Information
The dataset for the three generation has been included in three separate folders.

1. `gen0` - Each of the files in this folder contains data related to different boundary conditions for generation 0.

* `boundary_1.csv` - data for the boundary conditions `P(0) = 0, v_z(0) = 1.96`
* `boundary_2.csv` - data for the boundary conditions `P(0) = 101325, v_z(0) = 1.96`
* `boundary_3.csv` - data for the boundary conditions `P(0) = 81030, v_z(0) = 1.96`
* `boundary_4.csv` - data for the boundary conditions `P(0) = 121590, v_z(0) = 1.96`
* `boundary_5.csv` - data for the boundary conditions `P(0) = 0, v_z(0) = 1.57`
* `boundary_6.csv` - data for the boundary conditions `P(0) = 101325, v_z(0) = 1.57`
* `boundary_7.csv` - data for the boundary conditions `P(0) = 81030, v_z(0) = 1.57`
* `boundary_8.csv` - data for the boundary conditions `P(0) = 121590, v_z(0) = 1.57`

2. `gen1` - Each of the files in this folder contains data related to different boundary conditions for generation 1.

* `boundary_1.csv` - data for the boundary conditions `P(0) = 0, v_z(0) = 2.21`
* `boundary_2.csv` - data for the boundary conditions `P(0) = 90067, v_z(0) = 2.21`

* `boundary_7.csv` - data for the boundary conditions `P(0) = 72053, v_z(0) = 1.77`
* `boundary_8.csv` - data for the boundary conditions `P(0) = 108080, v_z(0) = 1.77`
